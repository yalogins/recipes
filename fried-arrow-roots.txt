    5 Arrow roots( you can use more or less)
    1 large onion chopped
    3 Tablespoons of cooking oil
    a teaspoon of salt
    a teaspoon of royco (optional)

Peel the arrow roots then cut them into size able pieces. Wash them then let them dry. Fry the onions in a cooking pot under medium heat until they are almost golden brown then add the salt and royco subject to your preferences. I added 1/4 chilli cube to mine( I am really addicted to spices).


Stir for 30 seconds so that the spices can cook then add the nduma.

add a 11/2 cups of water then let it simmer for 10 minutes or until it is ready to eat. Normally, I leave some ‘soup’ so that when I want to warm it, it won’t be too dry. The soup should be a bit thick but just enough.

You can eat the nduma for breakfast with tea, coffee, porridge, juice or you can have it with rice or just as it is.
